# Website Admin

Can be used to start, stop, and restart another Flask server (or multiple others), with capability for other admin features. Easy to connect to webhooks, like GitHub webhooks which can be used to stop a server, pull new changes, and then restart the server, all when you commit a change, as well as many other customizable options. It's easy to modify it to do different actions depending on which branch was updated.
